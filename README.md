# repoiser
Automatically checkout, build and test a set of depending repositories

Currently this only works very well for the repositories used for adcman and ccman2 within the Q-Chem quantum chemistry project,
although parts of the project are very general (like the dependency resolution between the different repositories) and could
be generalised easily very soon.

Documentation is also on the TODO ...
